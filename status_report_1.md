# Status Report 1

## Accomplishments:

### Ashwin:

- Implemented linting for Ansible scripts to enhance code quality. [Commit Link](https://github.ncsu.edu/asapre/csc-519-project/commit/7d377a80f44de464f8c6522a6febbec76ba68e04)
- Established branch protection rules to safeguard the integrity of the codebase.
- Ensured adherence to best practices for the Coffee project's initial setup.

### Nitesh:

- Successfully crafted an Ansible playbook for setting up the coffee project. [Commit Link](https://github.ncsu.edu/asapre/csc-519-project/commit/d5827552dcb90e1afb5037877572f602cb8668cf)
- Introduced task lists and a timeline to streamline project management and execution.

### Sumit:

- Enhanced code quality by implementing linting for JavaScript in the coffee project. [Commit Link](https://github.ncsu.edu/asapre/csc-519-project/commit/861fdda71c7adbfaf5f86c55e49621eecd50c0c9)
- Implemented automation capabilities by setting up GitHub Actions with a self-hosted runner VCL.
- Compiled a comprehensive Status Report 1, documenting the team's progress.

## In Progress & Next Steps:

### Ashwin:

- Investigate and implement a robust failure reporting mechanism to enhance pipeline reliability.
- Propose and implement a feature flag setup on Redis for controlled feature deployment.
- Testing

### Nitesh:

- Explore advanced deployment strategies, focusing on deploying code inside containers.
- Prepare a detailed Status Report 2 to provide insights into the team's ongoing efforts.
- Testing

### Sumit:

- Leverage GitHub Actions to execute an automated test suite, ensuring code integrity.
- Thoroughly document progress and insights in Status Report 2 for transparent communication.
- Testing

## Retrospective for the Sprint:

### What Worked Well:
- Effective Collaboration: The team demonstrated good collaboration skills.
- Successful Implementation of Linting: The implementation of linting for both Ansible and JavaScript improved code quality.
- Milestone Achievement: Achieved milestones such as branch protection rules and task lists, enhancing project organization.

### What Didn't Work:
- Testing Automation Delay: Delays were encountered in setting up automated testing suite. Something we planned to do before status report 1 but couldn't do it.
- Communication is Key: We have to be more commited to have a stronger collaboration as testing phase may bring about testing times.

### What we would do differntly:
- Continuous Learning: Acknowledge the learning curve in adopting new tools like GitHub Actions and plan for additional time accordingly.
- Refine Planning: Allocate dedicated time for planning.
- Regular Check-ins: Implement more frequent check-ins to address challenges in real-time.
